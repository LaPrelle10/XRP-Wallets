# Standalone

Start a New Genesis Ledger in Stand-Alone Mode
In stand-alone mode, you can have rippled create a new genesis ledger. This provides a known state, with none of the ledger history from the production XRP Ledger. (This is very useful for unit tests, among other things.)

To start rippled in stand-alone mode with a new genesis ledger, use the -a and --start options:
rippled -a --start --conf=/path/to/rippled.cfg
For more information on the options you can use when starting rippled in stand-alone mode, see Commandline Usage: Stand-Alone Mode Options.

In a genesis ledger, the genesis address holds all 100 billion XRP. The keys of the genesis address are hardcoded  as follows:

Address: rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh

Secret: snoPBrXtMeMyMHUVTgbuqAfg1SUTb ("masterpassphrase")
